# ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

Lately, I've been reading a lot of books and content in English and I always make notes on my cell phone of new words and expressions.

The problem is that the tool is pretty limited. It does not allow me to sort alphabetically, and it does not allow me to group by themes, nor is it possible to translate automatically.

I am preparing an application to solve this problem and,  why not, to help other people.

I'm in full production. I hope to be able to share the results soon.
